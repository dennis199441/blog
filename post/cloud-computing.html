            <p>Cloud computing architecture consists of front-end platform, back-end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network. It allows organisations to focus on their main business instead of resources, infrastructures and maintenance by using third-party cloud.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, if an organisation develops a software, an in-house data centre is needed in order to deal with data storage and maintenance issues and everything can be done without internet as long as there is a stable local network.</p>

            <p>Using cloud computing architecture, the in-house data centre is not needed. The organisation can leverage the internet and shift everything to a cloud data centre provided by a third-party such as Amazon, Google or Microsoft. A cloud data centre consists a lot of servers on site.</p>

            <p>Compare to the in-house data centre, a cloud data centre always performs better in terms of scalability, flexibility, agility and computing power as the service provider can optimise the server utilisation by sharing resources among servers.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, organisations can get rid of the in-house data centre and use cloud as a service provided by third-party. There are three common ways to use cloud as a service. They are Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).</p>

            <p>The Software as a Service (SaaS) allows businesses to provide direct access to the applications by employee, partners or clients. Since the applications are managed on the cloud, there are no licences or upgrades to maintain and users donâ€™t have to worry about installation, setup and running of the application.</p>

            <p>The Platform as a Service (PaaS) is an application development platform delivered on demand. It allows developer to focus on software development without worrying about the underlying hardware, software, provisioning and hosting issues. Usually a PaaS includes operating system, program execution environment, database, web server etc.

            <p>The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a service that provides computing power, storage and networking on demand such as computing infrastructure, virtual machines and other resources. Using this external infrastructure service, organisations can eliminate the cost of maintaining a in-house data centre.</p>

            <p>For example, we would like to create a web-based machine learning application. We can code the web application on our personal computer, train the machine learning model on Google Cloud Engine and deploy the application to Google App Engine. Once we successfully deployed our application on the cloud, everything is ready and user can access our web application anytime, anywhere as long as they are connected to the internet.</p>

            <p>The above example shows how we can utilise cloud technology using SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. First, Google Cloud Engine is an IaaS. It allows us to have extra computing power to train our model. Second, Google App Engine is a PaaS. It provides us with a suitable environment to execute our program. Finally, our web application is a SaaS. Everything is ready on the cloud and users can directly access the application without install, setup and run the software itself.</p>
